| :------------- | :----------: | -----------: |

|   set value depending on the size of the pizza. | 500|   |
| Determine the cost for the crust  |    200 |     |
| The total cost of a pizza should constitute, the crust, topping(s) and size of the pizza|(700+200 transport)     ||
| |     |On checkout, the application displays the ordersâ€™ summary together with the total amount charged. For example, if the customer has made more than one pizza order, on checkout the application displays a summary of all the orders he/she has made and the total amount to pay for all his/her orders.|
